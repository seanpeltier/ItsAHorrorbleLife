  <h3 class="questions"><strong>What was your first introduction to horror? How old were you?</strong></h3><p>I remember being about 6 or 7 years old and having a family discussion about whether or not my brother and I were old enough to watch Gremlins. We convinced my parents that we were and I was definitely very scared by it. The thing that really stuck with me is the gremlin that explodes in the microwave.</p>

      <h3 class="questions">In your opinion, what are 3 underrated horror films that everyone should watch at least once?</h3>
      <img class="poster" src="posters2/upgrade.jpg" alt="Upgrade Movie Poster" width="200" height="300">    <p>Thereâ€™s just not enough people talking about this one.</p> 
      
      <img class="poster" src="posters/extra.jpg" alt="Extra Ordinary Movie Poster" width="200" height="300"> <p>Funny, charming and all around delightful. My wife, who does not like horror, absolutely loved this one.</p>

      <img class="poster" src="posters2/tcmng.jpg" alt="Texas Chainsaw Massacre: Next Generation Movie Poster" width="200" height="300"> <p>And finally, stay with me here- Texas Chainsaw: Massacre: the Next Generation. One of my go-to Thanksgiving time movies. It gets a lot of hate and it really isnâ€™t good, but it is bonkers and feels like a Thanksgiving movie even though it isnâ€™t.</p>
 
  <h3 class="questions">What was one of your most memorable movie theater experiences?</h3>
  <p><em>Donâ€™t Breathe</em>. Labor Day weekend and the theater was packed. I saw it with my brother and sister. Thereâ€™s a jump scene with a dog jumping into a car window and the lady next to my sister literally flew out of her seat and was flopping around on the floor like a fish. The squirming and muttered swearing during the turkey baster scene was unforgettable. That one scene had such a huge effect on everyone in the theater. It was a great movie to experience with a large crowd.</p>
