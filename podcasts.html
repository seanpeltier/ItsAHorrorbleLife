<h2>Ghosts In The Burbs</h2>
<h3>By: Sean Peltier</h3>

<p>Last Halloween, I stumbled across Ghost In The Burbs. Being a Connecticut native, I was thrilled to find a spooky podcast that's located in Wellesley, Massachusetts. Narrator and star of the podcast, Liz Sower talks about the residents of her small town. What started as a simple post on a bulletin board asking other locals to tell her their own spooky ghost stories, sends Liz down a rabbit hole of ghosts, monsters and much more!</p>

<p>I cannot recommend this podcast enough! Ms. Sower has a way of narrating a story that makes you feel like you're in the sleepy town of Wellesley.</p>

<p>If you enjoy the podcast, be sure to check out Liz Sower's two books <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Claire-Ghosts-Burbs-Book-1-ebook/dp/B07HGP8T1L/ref=sr_1_3?dchild=1&keywords=liz+sower&qid=1615428245&sr=8-3">Claire (Ghost In The Burbs Book 1)</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Lilith-Ghosts-Burbs-Liz-Sower-ebook/dp/B07YBT65RL/ref=pd_sim_1?pd_rd_w=Je5HO&pf_rd_p=ebeb67e6-7791-4c7b-b192-b6f9e73299d2&pf_rd_r=BBMYWSAA5EPT1A0T76NQ&pd_rd_r=1562872c-8e39-454e-951b-9d633baa9738&pd_rd_wg=XB3dw&pd_rd_i=B07YBT65RL&psc=1"> Lilith: A Ghost In The Burbs Story</a>
