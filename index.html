        <p> Welcome to It's A Horrorble Life! My name is Sean and I'm the creator of It's A Horrorble Life! IAHL is a place where all horror fans, old and new can come and share their love of horror without judgment.</p> 

        <p>I started this webpage for two reasons. 1.) I've been learning web development for a while and wanted a fun project to sharpen my skills and 2. I LOVE everything to do with the horror scene and community.</p>

        <p> This page will be updated over the next few weeks. We have alot in store including an interview with Art The Clown himself, David Howard Thornton and the Bram Stoker Award Winning Author Grady Hendrix!</p>
