    <p>No matter how much we love horror movies, we all have that one "classic" movie that seems like everyone has seen, except you. For some reason or another, we just never got around to see it. Some of those movies are actual good movies, and some just hold a special place in our heart because of nostalgia. This is what this page is for. My self and the Spooky Crew are going to choose movies that we should've watched years ago and discuss what it's like to watch it for the first time years after it initially released</p>

    <h2>Alice, Sweet Alice</h2>
    <h3>By: Sean Peltier</h3>

    <p><em>Alice, Sweet Alice</em> is a 1976 slasher directed by Alfred Sole. In 1961, a divorced catholic couple's life is turned upside down when one of their two adolescent daughters is suspected of her younger sister's brutal murder during her First Communion, and a series of subsequent stabbings.</p>

    <p>Waxwork Records has announched that they spent six years working on obtaining the score to this film. So I figured there's no better time than the present to check this film out for the first time.</p>

    <p>Be sure to check back soon for my review as I watch Alice, Sweet Alice for the first time!</p>
