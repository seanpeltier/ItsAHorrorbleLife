      <h2>Ghostemane - Anti-Icon</h2>
    <h3>By: Sean Peltier</h3>

    <p><a href="https://www.target.com/p/ghostemane-anti-icon-explicit-lyrics-vinyl/-/A-82275743?ref=tgt_adv_XS000000&AFID=google_pla_df&fndsrc=tgtao&DFA=71700000012510700&CPNG=PLA_Entertainment%2BShopping&adgroup=SC_Entertainment&LID=700000001170770pgs&LNM=PRODUCT_GROUP&network=g&device=c&location=9014930&targetid=pla-630444542857&ds_rl=1246978&ds_rl=1248099&gclid=Cj0KCQiAv6yCBhCLARIsABqJTjag9CeshPmrlbWqCrLM2YyHJKmtO_14r4EqtNRMHGGWycpqsUuP8CUaAnikEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds" target="_blank"><img class="left" src="images/antiicon.jpg" alt="Ghostemane - Anti-Icon" width="250" height="250"></a></p>
   
    <p>One day during the pandemic, I fell down the Youtube rabbit hole. I don't know how, but I came across a video from an artist named <em>Ghostemane</em>. What caught my eye was the title of the track,<em>Euronymous</em>. For those of you that don't know, Euronymous was a member of the black metal group <em>Mayhem</em>, until his untimely murder at the hands of fellow Black Metal Musician, Varg Vikernes. If you'ld like to know more about this story, you should check out the film <a href="https://www.hulu.com/movie/lords-of-chaos-75256b5c-9098-45b2-8fdd-3cea4f19d3e3?entity_id=75256b5c-9098-45b2-8fdd-3cea4f19d3e3">Lords of Chaos</a> on Hulu or read the book of the same title.</p>

    <p>The music video looked like a Walt Disney fever dream. While I was drawn in by the visuals, I was quickly snapped out of it by what I was hearing. It was speed rap mixed with metal. As I listened, I realized that not only was Ghostemane talented with his flows, but the lyrics were really well written. This started my journey of  digging deeper into his Youtube videos and discography. Indie artist Poppy, who is also his fiancee, directed the music videos for <em>Hydrochloride</em> and <em>Lazaretto</em>. The album was supposed to be his major label debut, however due to the label not allowing him to have more control over his music and the direction he wanted to go in, he dropped the deal and decided to release his album independently. But before I go into the review of <em>Anti-Icon</em>, I think it's a good idea to see who is behind the facepaint.</p>

    <p>Eric Whitney, better known as Ghostemane, came on the music scene when he released his self-produced album, <em>Blackmage</em>. The album showcased a mix of his hardcore and punk roots with a mix of Memphis rap. The album created a large buzz in the underground community. After the release of <em>Blackmage</em>, Ghostemane released numerous singles, EP's and 2 more full length albums, <em>Hexada</em> in 2017, and then the critically acclaimed <em>N/O/I/S/E</em> in 2018.</p>

    <p>The album starts off with <em>Intro.Destitute</em>. With the slow build up and then heavy guitar riffs. The intro ends with Ghoste whispering <q>It all started with....</q>. When the intro ends and the first songg off the album, <em>Vagabond</em> starts, he finishes his thoughts. <q>It all started when you left me for dead, now I've been a wreck and Momma told me daddy ain't gonna be back.</q>. The album starts off heavy emotionally and musically and doesn't let up.</p>

    <p><em>Anit-Icon</em> was an early Halloween gift to Ghostemane's fans, releasing it on October 21, 2020. As <em>Lazaretto</em> starts, its apparent that Ghostemane was heavily influence from many Industrial and Nu Metal acts, such as <em>Nine Inch Nails</em> and <em>KoRn</em>. The music continues to bend genres from Trap to Metal, with Ghoste spitting as fast as his accompanying riffs. The album reminds of an anxiety attack. It starts off slow but you know it's coming. It builds up and as soon as the second song kicks in, it doesn't stop. Constant heavy beats and guitars with spitfire rhymes that make your heart race are covered in the 13 tracks with a runtime clocking in at 36:26.<p>

    <p>If you haven't heard of Ghostemane yet, I strongly suggest you check him out. You have two options. You can start off with this album, which I think is fantastic. It's heavy and hits a sweet spot that both hip hop and metal fans will come to appreciate. Your other option is to go back to the beginning of his discography, and hear how Ghoste grew with each album. Either way, you can't go wrong with checking him out. He was playing the main stage of Lollapalooza in 2019 and I can't wait to see what he has in store for a tour once the pandemic is over, So keep your eyes and ears open, because I have a feeling we will be hearing much more him in the near future.</p>

    <h2>Ice Nine Kills - The Silver Scream</h2>

    <p><a href="https://store.iceninekills.com/products/the-silver-scream-final-cut-cd" target="_blank"><img class="left" src="images/INK-TSSVinyl.png" alt="Ice Nine Kills - The Silver Scream Vinyl" width="350" height="350"></a></p>
   

    <p>Ice Nine Kills is a metalcore / theatricore band out of Boston, Massachusetts. Spencer Charnas, the co-founder and lead singer of the band is known for his love of horror. This was displayed in their 2015 album, <em>Every Trick In The Book</em>. Every song on the album was about a different book. A few horror masterpieces made their way onto the album including <em>The Exorcist by Peter William Blatty</em> (Communion of The Cursed), <em>Carrie by Stephen King</em> (Hell In The Hallways) and <em>Dracula by Bram Stoker</em> (Bloodbath & Beyond).</p>

    <p>Spencer and the boys took their love of themed albums one step further with the release of <strong>The Silver Scream</strong>. The album was originally released on October 5th, 2018 after the band came off of a successful tour on the final Warped Tour. This album is a love-letter to some of the greatest horror films of all time. From Halloween to Jaws, there is something for every horror and metal fan alike.</p>
    
    <p>So, without further ado, ladies and gents, grab your drinks and popcorn, strap yourself in and join along as we take a deep dive into <strong><em>The Silver Scream</em></strong>. 

    <p class="ink">
        <br>
        <ol>
            <li>The American Nightmare:</li><p class="ink">The album kicks off with an ode to <em>A Nightmare on Elm Street</em>. As the song starts, you hear a friendly voice that explains the benefits of getting to bed at a decent hour. Throughout the song, you're taken along on a trip in the mind of Freddy Krueger including  clever lyrics "Craven my revenge from the shallow grave, where I went down in flames, the beat has awakened".</li></p>
            <li>Thank God It's Friday:</li><p class="ink">If you start an album with a song about Freddy Krueger, what's your next move? Make a song about Jason Voorhees, of course. The song starts off with a haunting campfire chant "He drowned in all our sins. He drowned in our mistakes. Fueled by the flood, we pay in blood. The curse of Crystal Lake", that explains why Jason comes back summer after summer to exact revenge for he and his mother. Be sure to listen as Spencer does one of the best impressions of Crazy Ralph.</p>
            <li>Stabbing In The Dark:</li><p class="ink">"Stabbing In The Dark" paints the picture of a town called Haddonfield. Everything seems perfect except for the fact that it's been 15 years since a horrible massacre occured. Now Michael has returned home to finish what he started. Spencer takes you on a journey through Michael's mind leaving a warning for the parents of Haddonfield. "A former portrait of perfection, painted without plight. Now Haddonfield's my battlefield. Your kids won't make it home tonight."</p>
            <li>SAVAGES:</li><p class="ink">The song starts with the iconic sound from the Texas Chainsaw Massacre. The sound that gave me nightmares as a kid. This was the first single off of the album and sounds like a horror anthem, complete with a catchy hook "We are the SAVAGES, eating you alive".</p>
            <li>The Jig Is Up feat. Randy Strohmeyer:</li><p class="ink">The song reiterates the motto that Jigsaw tried to tell us throughout the Saw franchise. To be good to yourself, others and not to take things for granted. INK brought on former guitarist from the band <em>Finch</em> for this one. The lyrics explain Jigsaw's process and what he looked for in his victims. "I saw through the selfish but saw no soul. They saw through skin, they saw through bone."</p>
            <li>A Grave Mistake:</li><p class="ink">As a lover of The Crow, this song was an instant classic in my eyes. Then as I listned to the lyrics, it was apparent that once again, they are taking us into the mind of what the main character was thinking. Spencer sings with anguish and pain as he recites the gut-wrenching lyrics. "These vengeful thoughts trapped underneath: rage, scorn, misery. Payback for what you took from me: hope, love, sanity".</p>
            <li>Rocking The Boat feat. Jeremy Schwartz:</li><p class="ink">Rocking the boat is the song about Jaws you didn't know you needed until you hear it. For this one, the boys brought back co-founder and former co-lead singer / guitarist of Ice Nine Kills, Jeremy Schwartz. The song has it all from a heavy guitar riff of the infamous "duh nuh duh nuh" to the distress call requesting assistance for the Orca "The boat is under attack. It's a Great White, over. <em>Roger that: ETA is fifteen minutes.</em> In fifteen minutes, we'll be fucking shark bate!"</p>
            <li>Enjoy Your Slay feat. Sam Kubrick:</li><p class="ink">What's better than a song about Stanley Kubrick's <em>The Shining?</em>. Having Stanley's grandsom, Sam Kubrick, lead singer and guitarist of the metal core band Shields on the song. The song goes into Jack Torrance's psyche as he slowly loses his mind and starts his murderous rampage. "Turn the page, disengage and destroy. All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy."</p>
            <li>Freak Flag:</li><p class="ink">The only song on the album to not be based off a film made between the 2000's, <em>Freak Flag</em> sounds like an anthem inspired by Rob Zombie's The Devil's Rejects. The song doesn't get too deep into the history of the Firefly Gang (Captain Spaulding, Baby and Otis). However it does try to let us "rejects" know we're not alone. "We're all messed up inside, and forced to act like everything's alright. Wave those freak flags high, rejected 'till we die."</p>
            <li>The World In My Hands:</li><p class="ink">Yes, the album is called "The Silver Scream", but they added a film that fits in many genres. <em>The World In My Hands</em>tells the story of Edward Scissorhands. It's a harrowing tale of how cruel it is to know exactly what you want, being so close to having it, but not being allowed. You can just feel his anguish as Spencer sings "Now I'm lost on my own, in search of something real. How cruel to be exposed, to everything that I can't touch, but still feel."</p>
            <li>Merry Axe-Mas:</li><p class="ink"><em>Merry Axe-Mas</em> has the most obscure movie reference on the album, 1984's "Silent Night, Deadly Night". I personally was ecstatic when the song started and I heard the warning from Billy's grandfather "If you meet Santa Claus tonight boy, you better run for your life". The movie is about a young boy named Billy who sees his parents get murdered by a maniac dressed up like Santa Claus. He and his brother Ricky (who we will meet more in Silent Night Deadly Night 2) are sent to an orphanage. As Billy grows up, he works at a toy store and has to dress up like Santa. Well, his PTSD kicks in and Billy goes on a murder spree, punishing those who he deems "naughty". It's a great movie and this song is the perfect tribute to it. Both are highly recommended!</p>
            <li>Love Bites feat. Chelsea Talmadge:</li><p class="ink"><em>Love Bites</em> recruits Stranger Things' Chelsea Talmadge for this duet about An American Werewolf In London. Chelsea wasn't a musician, however, after a night with Spencer at a Karaoke bar, she impressed him enough for him to ask her to perform on the song. The song goes deep into the mindset of the protagonist as the full moon hits, and he transforms. He doesn't want to be alone, which is where Chelsea's character comes in, to comfort and protect. "Safe in my arms you will stay, because every dog has it's day". 
            <li>IT Is The End feat. JR Wasilewski & Buddy Schaub:</li><p class="ink">The final song off of the album starts off with soothing rain and faint circus music. We sit and listen as Pennywise lures poor Georgie into the sewer on that fateful day. "Oh Georgie, you can trust me sweet child. Step right this way, I'm at your service with a smile. Believe me, IT's nothing to fear. When I feast on your flesh, you'll see that we all float down here!". The song is filled with heavy guitars, horns provided by JR Wasilewski and Buddy Schaub from Less Than Jake and a ton of references to the Staphen King Masterpiece.</p>
