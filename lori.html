<h3 class="questions"><strong>What was your first introduction to horror? How old were you?</strong></h3> <p>I was about 4 or 5 years old.  I was at my uncle and auntâ€™s house with my brother, sister and four cousins.  With the exception of my youngest cousin, everyone else was older than me and they wanted to watch A Nightmare on Elm Street.  I donâ€™t know who thought it was a good idea to let me stay in the room.  Freddy Krueger scared the hell out of me!  I was petrified to even leave the room to go to the bathroom.</p>

<h3 class="questions"><strong> What was one of your most memorable movie theater experiences?</strong></h3>

<p>In high school, my friend and I went to the movie theater to see The Blair Witch Project.  About halfway through the film, I was getting such severe motion sickness from all of the camera movement that I had to keep my eyes closed.  I ended up making it to the end and back to my car without incident.  However, my friend was not as lucky.  As soon as she got into the passengerâ€™s seat and closed the door, she promptly reopened it and threw up all over the pavement.  Scarred for life!</p>
